The difference between UUPS and Transparent Proxy Pattern is where the upgrade logic/function is located.  In Transparent Proxy Pattern, it is directly placed in the proxyâ€™s contract, while in UUPS, it is in a logic contract, separate from the proxy (the proxy links to the logic contract with a call). UUPS allows for more flexibility as you can change the logic contract while the proxy is immutable and still allow users to use it without disruption.
